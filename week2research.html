 1.  I could definitely label my links more clearly.  I have some confusing names, that even I have to double check when going to make changes in my css file.  Other than that, I don't know what I could do to such a simple application.  I only have a few buttons, so they should be easy to navigate with a screen reader.</p>
<p>
2.  Some of the common frustrations that I noticed were the times when the speech would stutter if the user paused near the icon.  I don't know how I could fix them, but it seems like voice recognition would be the answer.  I'm sure they have a good reason for not using it, but it seems easier to say, "Open browser" than to search around for it with your finger.
