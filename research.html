    <h1>Week 3 Research</h1>
    
    <p>1. What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?<br><br>

  Games and a messenger apps.<br><br>

2. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?<br><br>

  Video and audio recorders.<br><br>

3. What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?<br><br>

  Messenger apps and games.<br><br>

4. I can infer that games would sell better in UK and US, while camera functionality and voice recording would be good if you plan to target Japan.<br><br>

5. The Android os Jelly Bean isn't even a factor right now.  At less than 1% global installed rate, it wouldn't make sense to focus on that os, no matter which market you were trying to target.  <br><br>

6.  The average plan in the US is about $8-$10 per GB.  In the UK, they pay around 5 Euros per GB, and in Japan it's more than 3,000 yen per GB, which comes out to over $40.  Now I see why the Japanese don't download large files like games. <br><br>

7.  I would try to appeal to every audience by suggesting a messenger app that has camera and voice functionality.  Maybe some way to edit the photo images and share them with friends.  That's if the Japanese market had to be addressed, and depending on how much time the company wanted to spend on development.  If we could leave the Japanese market for another one that matches the UK and US, I would suggest a freemium game with in app messaging. <br><br> </p>
